# 3D Sandbox Project

Welcome to my 3D Sandbox project! This repository provides a 3D playground built on Three.js for testing and exploring game mechanics, shaders, textures, models, physics simulations, animations, and interactive elements.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm, a package manager for Node.js)

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

1. **Install Three.js:**

	Three.js is a JavaScript library for 3D graphics.

   ```bash
   npm install --save three
   ```
2. **Install Vite:**

	Vite is a build tool that supports modern JavaScript tooling and development workflows.

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev vite
   ```
   
3. **Running the project:**

	From your terminal, you can start the development server using the Vite command:
   ```bash
   npx vite
